For this assignment, you must work in a group of two. Your objective is to create a simple, web-based task management system. The application must be written in NodeJS, Express and EJS.

The requirements go as follow:

a) The system should allow a user to create, delete, update, list tasks in his/her TODO list. Each task must have a title and a due date.
- express requests
- html: table and checklist
  - form for title and due date (create task)
(Update which fields?)


b) The data of the tasks must be stored in HTTP cookies.

c) Your system must allow a user to login to the system. In the login page, the user must provide a username and password. Assume, the login details of all the users are stored in an array in the server side.

d) All unauthenticated users (i.e. guests) must login before using the system.
